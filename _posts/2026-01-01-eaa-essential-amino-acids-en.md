# Essential Amino Acids (EAA): Why Protein Supplementation Alone Is Not Enough

> Many people think supplementing with protein is enough, but scientific research tells us that the balance of essential amino acids is equally important.

## What Are Essential Amino Acids?

The human body needs 20 amino acids to synthesize proteins, of which 9 **must be obtained from food**, called Essential Amino Acids (EAA):

1. **Essential Amino Acids (9)**
   - Histidine
   - Isoleucine
   - Leucine
   - Lysine
   - Methionine
   - Phenylalanine
   - Threonine
   - Tryptophan
   - Valine

2. **Conditionally Essential Amino Acids**
   - Arginine
   - Cysteine
   - Glutamine
   - Glycine
   - Proline
   - Tyrosine

## Why Protein Supplementation Alone Is Not Enough?

Traditional protein supplementation often focuses on **total amount**—how many grams of protein to eat daily. However, the latest nutrition research suggests:

> **The amino acid composition ratio** may be more important than total protein amount.

### Key Findings

1. **Leucine Threshold**
   - Leucine is the "switch" that triggers muscle protein synthesis
   - Each intake needs 2.5-3g of leucine to maximize synthesis

2. **Amino Acid Balance**
   - The complete ratio of essential amino acids determines protein quality
   - Supplementing with a single amino acid may disrupt the balance

3. **Advantages of EAA Supplementation**
   - More comprehensive than BCAA
   - More efficient than whole protein
   - Especially important for the elderly (anabolic resistance)

## Practical Recommendations

### 1. Focus on Protein Quality

Choose protein sources with high **PDCAAS** or **DIAAS** scores:

| Food | PDCAAS | DIAAS |
|------|--------|-------|
| Whey Protein | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Eggs | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Beef | 0.92 | 0.89 |
| Soy | 0.91 | 0.80 |

### 2. Distribute Intake

- Consume 25-40g of quality protein per meal
- Every 3-4 hours
- Replenish soon after training

### 3. Consider EAA Supplementation

Extra EAA supplementation may help for:
- Elderly (muscle anabolic resistance)
- Athletes (high-intensity training)
- Vegetarians/Vegans
- Those with inadequate protein intake

## Conclusion

Focusing only on total protein intake is not enough. Understanding amino acid composition and balance is true **precision nutrition**.
